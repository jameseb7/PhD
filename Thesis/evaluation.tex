\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation-chapter}

In this chapter, we evaluate the model and compilation strategy,
considering what assurances can be gained from mechanisation of the
model and proofs of the compilation rules.
We also compare code produced by our strategy to that produced by icecap,
using some examples to evaluate the strategy.

Next, in Section~\ref{mechanisation-of-models-section}, we consider
the assurances gained from mechanisation of the models that form the
starting point of the strategy.
Then, in Section~\ref{proofs-of-laws-section}, we discuss the proofs of
the compilation rules used in the strategy and how they provide
assurances of the correctness of the strategy.
Afterwards, in Section~\ref{tool-support-section}, we consider
mechanisation of the strategy and then, in
Section~\ref{examples-section}, we evaluate the strategy with some
examples.
Finally, we conclude in
Section~\ref{evaluation-final-considerations-section}.
