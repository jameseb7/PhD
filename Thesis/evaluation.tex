\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation-chapter}

In this chapter, we evaluate the model and compilation strategy,
considering what assurances can be gained from mechanisation of the
model and proofs of the compilation rules.
We also compare code produced by our strategy to that produced by icecap,
using some examples to evaluate the strategy.

\section{Mechanisation of Models}

% mention use of CZT for syntax and typechecking
% mention Z/EVES proofs?
% have we found any errors?

\section{Proofs of Laws}

% discuss compilation rules and their proofs
% explain the importance of the algebraic proof style
% explain source of laws used for proofs

\section{Tool Support}

% discuss mechanisation of strategy
% explain considerations surrounding bytecode subset
% explain what confidence this brings

\section{Examples}

% illustrate with some examples
% compare to icecap

\section{Final Considerations}
